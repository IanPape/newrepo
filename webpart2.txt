## ****Part Two: Practice Tools****

1. Using ***curl***, make a ***GET*** request to the *icanhazdadjoke.com* API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”

    What does a pirate pay for his corn? A buccaneer!
    What did the pirate say on his 80th birthday? Aye Matey!
    Why couldn't the kid see the pirate movie? Because it was rated arrr!
    Why are pirates called pirates? Because they arrr!
    Why do pirates not know the alphabet? They always get stuck at "C".ian@DESKTOP-1P5IIVG:~/springboard$
